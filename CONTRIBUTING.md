# Mappets

Contributing Guide

## Before you start

Please, make sure you have read the project description. If don't, read rigth [clicking here]().

## Installing

As our stack is not a simple one we opted for standardizing our instructions do [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which will help you spin up every service in a few commands.

Everything is expected to work with:

```console
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up
```

**Note:** `docker-compose up` is just a health check to assure all dependencies are succesfully installed and the project is running well. To run properly Mappets there are a few more steps (migrations, for example), which are the ones below.

Then `.env` file you just copied contains [environment variables for Mappets]. Feel free to customize it.

### Running

Example to run only the landing page:

```console
$ docker-compose app composer install
$ docker-compose app php artisan migrate
$ docker-compose app yarn install 
```

The spin up the web server:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then browse from [`0.0.0.0:8000`](http://0.0.0.0:8000).

## The basics of contributing

A lot of discussions about ideas take place in the [Issues](https://github.com/Mappets/website/issues) section.

```

Please, note that we prefix branch names with GitHub usernames, this helps us in keeping track of changes and who is working on them.


**4. Do what you do best**
